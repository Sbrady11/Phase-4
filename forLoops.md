## For loops

again, like other languages, except just a little more verbose

can be used specifically for keys

    webster = {
    "Aardvark" : "A star of a popular children's cartoon show.",
    "Baa" : "The sound a goat makes.",
    "Carpet": "Goes on the floor.",
    "Dab": "A small amount."
    }

    for key in webster:
      print webster[key]
    
    > A star of a popular children's cartoon show.
    Goes on the floor.
    A small amount.
    The sound a goat makes.
