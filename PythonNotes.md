Looks like its mostly like ruby (just oo)

dont need a def or anything, or let, just ascribe a value

    eg. my_variable = 10
    pring my_variable

booleans require capitalization
     
     True/False

INDENTATION IS SUPER IMPORTANT

    > def spam():
      eggs = 12
      return eggs

    print spam()

Comments '#'
  triple " for making a multi line commment
  """Comment
  yes
  """
  
math can be inside of variables
powers can be **, so 2**3 = 8

when coming to escaping characters, use a '\' within a string

value of strings, accesing by index:
Use "somestring"[0] returns 's'
